IPC:
- A module capable of IPC has the following parts:
    - A server or remote part, which implements the code with most processing overhead,
      and which may be run in a separate process;
    - A client or local part, which provides local access to the remote part when
      separate processes are used;
    - A client/server or stub interface, which defines the following:
        - events which may be emitted by the remote part;
        - messages which may be received by the remote part.
    - A set of support methods, which are additional parts of the module's API which are
      always run locally, and so have minimal processing overhead.
- Terminology: Client/Server or Local/Remote?
